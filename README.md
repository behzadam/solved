## Introduction

The "TypeScript Algorithms, Data Structures and Patterns" repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in TypeScript. It also includes various design patterns commonly used in software development. I'm refactoring [JavaScript Algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) from JavaScript to TypeScript.

- [Comparator](src/comparator/comparator.ts)
- [HashTable](src/hash-table/hash-table.ts)
- [MinHeap](src/heap/min-heap.ts)
- [MaxHeap](src/heap/max-heap.ts)
- [LinkedList](src/linked-list/linked-list.ts)
- [Queue](src/queue/queue.ts)
- [Stack](src/stack/stack.ts)
- [MaxPriorityQueue](src/priority-queue/max-priority-queue.ts)
- [MinPriorityQueue](src/priority-queue/min-priority-queue.ts)
- [Trie](src/trie/trie.ts)
- [BinarySearch](src/binary-search/binary-search.ts) -> watch video: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE9yPJuE5aY&t=13s)
- [LinearSearch](src/linear-search/linear-search.ts)

### Code challanges

- [Transpose Matrix](src/problem/transpose-matrix/transpose-matrix.ts)

Please note that the repository is still a work in progress, and new algorithms and patterns will be added over time.
