## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of algorithms, data structures, and design patterns implemented in TypeScript. It includes code and patterns from the "JavaScript Algorithms" repository, translated from JavaScript to TypeScript. [JavaScript Algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)

### Data structure

- [Comparator](src/data-structure/comparator/comparator.ts)
- [HashTable](src/data-structure/hash-table/hash-table.ts)
- [MinHeap](src/data-structure/heap/min-heap.ts)
- [MaxHeap](src/data-structure/heap/max-heap.ts)
- [LinkedList](src/data-structure/linked-list/linked-list.ts)
- [Queue](src/data-structure/queue/queue.ts)
- [Stack](src/data-structure/stack/stack.ts)
- [MaxPriorityQueue](src/data-structure/priority-queue/max-priority-queue.ts)
- [MinPriorityQueue](src/data-structure/priority-queue/min-priority-queue.ts)
- [Trie](src/data-structure/trie/trie.ts)
- [BinarySearch](src/data-structure/ds/binary-search/binary-search.ts)
- [LinearSearch](src/data-structure/linear-search/linear-search.ts)

### Code challanges

#### Array

- [Find missing numbers](src/challange/array/find-missing-numbers/find-missing-numbers.ts)
- [Find max subarray](src/challange/array/find-max-subarray/find-max-subarray.ts)
- [Find majority element](src/challange/array/find-majority-element/find-majority-element.ts)
- [Max profit](src/challange/array/max-profit/max-profit.ts)
- [Move Zeroes](src/challange/array/move-zeroes/move-zeroes.ts)

Please note that the repository is still a work in progress, and new algorithms and patterns will be added over time.
