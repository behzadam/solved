# Solved
In this repository I'm refactoring [JavaScript Algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) codes to TypeScript and are just my practices in algorithms, data-structures and design patterns and not production ready.

- [Comparator](https://github.com/behzadam/solved/tree/master/src/comparator) ( some functionalities inspired from Java Comparator ).
- [HashTable](https://github.com/behzadam/solved/tree/master/src/hash-table)
- [Heap](https://github.com/behzadam/solved/tree/master/src/heap)
- [LinkedList](https://github.com/behzadam/solved/tree/master/src/linked-list)
- [PriorityQueue](https://github.com/behzadam/solved/tree/master/src/priority-queue)
- [Trie](https://github.com/behzadam/solved/tree/master/src/trie)
- WIP
